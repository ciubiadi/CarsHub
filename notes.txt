Prerequisites:
- VSCode extension Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
- HeadlessUI : provides commopnents out of the box. : headlessui.com/react
- RapidAPI (Cars by API-Ninjas) : https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas
- ImaginStudio Car Image API : https://www.imagin.studio/car-image-api

Project Structure:
- I put "components" folder in the root and not in the app because accordingly to the Next.JS 13.4 syntax in the app folder I should have the pages, layouts, and routes

REFRESHERS:
- overflow: hidden = verflow content is clipped at the element's padding box
- in global.css I use a lot of tailwind arbitrary values



Constants :
- I use this approach because I can add footer links or car manufacturers easier directly in the arrays.
